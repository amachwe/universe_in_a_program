Universe in a program

Create your own Universe...

We observe time as a progression of states. The clock hands tick, the rain falls, and the sun moves across the sky.

This can be visualised as an operation that takes the 'previous' state as input to give us the 'current' state. For example, our kick in the previous state makes the football move in the next state. This can also be thought of as effect following cause.

But there is a big flaw in this. Given the current state of the watch is dependent on its previous state then if we project backwards we will reach the birth of the universe via the assembly of the watch, the mining of the metals used, the evolution of humans, life and its building blocks showing up on Earth, the Earth itself being formed, the formation of the Solar System, the first-light of the Sun, all the way to the birth of the universe. 

Given the concept of current and previous states there has to be a previous state to the birth of the universe. Even if the universe keeps expanding and contracting like our heart - there is still a state before when it was being 'setup'. Every system has a setup stage. There is no such thing as an infinite sequence of states.

The way our universe functions looks suspiciously like a computer program. From a programs point of view it has to be triggered to execute. Once it is executing it does not care about anything else and it can happily keep on generating state after state based on rules till something external to the system (which is the running software) disrupts it. For example, hardware issues, loss of power, or interruption by the user.

Try it out with a simple program that starts at the lowest value of an integer (a negative value) in your favourite programming language (or ask ChatGPT to code it) and increments the value by 1 every second.
Execute the program. This program will never finish. It will take 292471208677.536 years to reach '0'. That is about 30 times the estimated current age of the universe. About 250 times the full lifespan of our Sun (few billion years).

For the bits and bytes living inside you computer executing the program - they have a stable universe where current state is influenced by the previous state. It will continue till we 'god-like' humans hit the power switch.
